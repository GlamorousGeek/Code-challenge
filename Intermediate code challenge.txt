
    The 2019 Nigerian Election is almost here and INEC has decided that this election, it would use an electronic voting machine in 5 states!
    You are on the SW development team and you have been put in charge of designing a ballot counting program. 
    
	The states are: 
	
	Lagos, Oyo, Abia, Enugu, and Kaduna.

    I have attached 5 other text files named: 

	[Lagos_votes] [Oyo_votes] [Abia_votes] [Enugu_votes] [Kaduna_votes] 
	 
	These text files contain Votes from each state. 
	
     The following parties running are: 

	 ACP, SDP, YYP, APC and PDP

   a. Using a function/class, count the number of votes  each party received in each state.  
       E.g 
	   
	   def Lagos(): 
			
			YYP = #Number of votes 
			APC = #Number of votes .
			PDP = #Number of votes 
		
		return 
	
	repeat the same format for the 4 other states. 

	
	
   b. Which party had the most votes in each state ? 
	  Please do not simply print the answer from you being able to see what the answer is. 
	  write some lines of code that comes to this conclusion 
      Implement this task using a function/class 
   
   c. who had the most votes in the entire country ? 
      Implement this task using a function/class for this task 
   
   d. Now suppose we find out that 20% of the APC votes from Lagos were from voters that did not exist, 
      and 30% of PDP's votes from Enugu were also falsified, 
      determine who might be the new winner? 
	  Implement this using a  function/class.
	  
   e. In addition to the falsification,suppose we found out that 30% of the YYP's total votes recorded by INEC were changed to ACP's vote, 
      determine who might be the new winner ?   	   Implement this using a function/class for this 

   f. Now suppose the inauguration date of the winner is May 15th 2019, write code that will always determine 
      the current number of days until the ceremony.  
	  define a function for this. 
	  No need to implement this using a function/class. 
	  
	g. Lastly out of these 5 parties,  tell me which party you are most likely to vote for? (free will answer).
